# Program Decision Log

> Records durable project-level decisions. Experiment-specific preregistrations remain authoritative for their own scope.

## 2026-08-29 — GitHub is canonical memory

**Decision:** Treat chat sessions as working contexts and GitHub as the source of truth.

**Reason:** The project spans GPT, Claude Code, multiple chats, long experiments, and frozen artifacts. Cross-chat continuity should not depend on model memory.

**Operational consequence:** substantial research actions end with committed status/handoff updates.

## 2026-08-29 — Separate research direction from execution value

**Decision:** Add a permanent execution lane to the program.

**Reason:** A system that improves benchmark/judge scores but cannot accomplish useful work has not demonstrated sufficient value.

**Execution standard:** every claimed capability improvement should eventually survive a task with an external success criterion.

**Preferred first domain:** coding / repository work, where build, tests, runtime behavior, regressions, cost, latency, repair cycles, and human intervention provide objective evidence.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Do not productize before internal proof

**Decision:** Prefer using the eventual system internally on real work before abstracting it into an API/platform.

**Reason:** Practical execution provides stronger evidence and exposes failure modes that benchmark-only development can miss.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Recursive improvement is a later research stage

**Decision:** Do not build recursive procedure optimization until the laboratory can reliably detect real procedure differences and those improvements generalize to unseen tasks.

**Reason:** Otherwise recursive search will optimize measurement quirks or the benchmark.

**Required progression:** trustworthy measurement → intervention effect → controllability → execution value → generalization → automated procedure discovery → recursive improvement.

---

## 2026-08-29 — Champion procedures must be frozen and versioned

**Decision:** Future procedure search will distinguish baseline, candidate, champion, and retired procedures.

**Reason:** A promising candidate must not overwrite the incumbent before independent validation.

**Future structure candidate:**
```text
procedures/
  baseline/
  candidates/
  champions/
  retired/
```

Do not create this engineering structure until procedure-discovery work is actually authorized.

## 2026-08-29 — External execution evidence outranks model-only judgment

**Decision:** Model judges can be useful instruments, but eventual practical claims require external checks wherever feasible.

Examples:
- coding → build/tests/runtime;
- factual research → evidence/citation checks;
- file transformations → exact artifact assertions;
- workflows → completion/error/intervention metrics.

This does not invalidate judge-based experiments; it limits what they are allowed to prove.
